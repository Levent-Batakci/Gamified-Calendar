# Onboarding

## Project Setup

First, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), potentially using `git clone` in your preferred CLI to pull the project down to your computer.

Familiarize yourself with [common git commands](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf), [CLI commands](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp), and [what Git is](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) if you aren't already.

In your CLI, navigate to the folder for the project and run `npm install` to instruct [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) to install all neccessary packages.

## Database

### Installation

The easiest way to install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) 

### Database Initialization

## Get react component to run
- [Syncfusion React Component Library\*](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/react) 
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You MUST create a trial account and download the web installer BEFORE attempting to run or install any of the packages. If not the program will not run.
If you can not get it to run, either contact the team member or checkout [our video demo](https://github.com/Levent-Batakci/Gamified-Calendar/blob/main/README.md)
## IDE: VSCode

### Run and Test

To test that things are working, run `npm run start` in the CLI and go to an example API route.
Example: `localhost:8080/Accounts`.

Test again to ensure that the application launches correctly.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** We have a settings file in the project that will automatically configure all of these settings for you.
If for some reason they don't work, come back here to do it manually.
(the settings that should work are formatting on save and using prettier to format)

Turn on `format on save` for Prettier.
Go to `Code > Preferences > Settings` (or via `cmd ,` on Mac) (or `File > Preferences > Settings` for Windows).
Search for `format on save` and make sure `Editor: Format On Save` is checked / yes.

### VSCode Extensions

When you launch the project in VSCode, you should see a popup in the bottom right asking you to "install all recommendeded extensions".
Click "install" to easily install all of the below extensions.

If for some reason you don't see this popup you can install them manually using the extensions button on the left sidebar.
Below are the recommended extensions that you should install.

- [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) (`orta.vscode-jest`)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)
